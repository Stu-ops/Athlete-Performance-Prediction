🏅 Athlete Performance Prediction
Predict athletic performance using biometric and training metrics with the power of machine learning.​

📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes a dataset of athlete metrics (e.g., heart rate, stamina, training hours) to predict performance levels. It offers a streamlined pipeline—from data processing to model prediction—and a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.​

🚀 Features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🧠 Model Training using scikit-learn

💾 Pipeline Serialization (pipe.pkl)

🌐 Streamlit UI (app.py) for real-time predictions

📈 Visualizations and insights included in Jupyter Notebooks​

🔍 Model Details
Features Used: heart_rate, stamina, training_hours, and other biometric stats.

Target: Athlete performance label (presumably categorical or numeric rating).

Model: Likely a regression or classification model trained using scikit-learn.

Pipeline: Serialized using joblib and saved as pipe.pkl for reuse in the Streamlit app.​
